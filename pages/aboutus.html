              <p>Tony had returned to Bournemouth from London.</p>
              <p>Nicki had returned to Dorchester from Northumberland.</p>
              <p>
                Both were attempting to rebuild themselves, after previously
                failed relationships and financial woes.
              </p>
              <p>Tony the awkward geek and Nicki the liberal homebody.</p>
              <p>
                There would never have been a good reason for the two to meet,
                but the world of Internet dating meant Tony came across Nicki
                one evening and enticed her with his wit and charm!
              </p>
              <p>
                There it began, something neither one ever predicted would
                result in much. Tony and Nicki met on the 8th June 2014... a
                date in Bournemouth, where a spark was ignited.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now these two could not be more different... Tony is a
                fact-based, black-and-white kind of guy, with a love for music,
                film, and all things geeky. Nicki is a morally righteous kind of
                girl, with a love for reality TV and TikTok.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both had commitment fears, character flaws, and previously made
                unwise life decisions. Neither really had much to offer, yet
                something special started between them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many may judge that Nicki is spoiled and Tony is soft. In fact,
                there is a lot of mutual respect and support. They share
                important core values like compassion and trust—and they share
                a lot of laughter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their differences have worked well at times. Nicki introduced
                Tony to Christmas decorations and ethical debates, while Tony
                introduced Nicki to new foods and to Game of Thrones, for which
                she’ll be forever grateful. There remain many differences: Tony
                refuses Big Brother and Nicki declines anything anime.
              </p>
              <p>
                They have built a home and life together, unique to them. Neither
                would say there haven’t been ups and downs, but nearly 10 years
                on, both have changed considerably. They’ve progressed in their
                careers, saved hard for a home, and rather than growing apart,
                they’ve grown together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their shared core values and united life goals are what led Nicki
                and Tony to decide to make their relationship official and tie
                the knot on December 13th, 2025.
